<h2>
The characters in KanjiVG differ from printed styles
</h2>

<p>
The characters in KanjiVG are based on handwritten Japanese
styles. These differ from printed characters in various ways. When
comparing KanjiVG to styles you can find on a computer, please be sure
to compare them to kyokashotai (教科書体) or kaisho (楷書) styles
rather than printed styles like Mincho or
Gothic. See <a href="ref.html">the references page</a> for the exact
details of the references used in creating the characters.
