list first.

<h2>
The characters in KanjiVG differ from printed styles
</h2>

<p>
The characters in KanjiVG are based on handwritten Japanese
styles. These differ from printed characters in various ways. When
comparing KanjiVG to styles you can find on a computer, please be sure
to compare them to kyokashotai (教科書体) or kaisho (楷書) styles
rather than printed styles like Mincho or
Gothic. See <a href="ref.html">the references page</a> for the exact
details of the references used in creating the characters.
</p>

<h2>
Why is this character missing?
</h2>

<p>
KanjiVG originally covered Japanese kanji only, specifically the kanji
of the JIS
standards. See <a href="https://kanjivg.tagaini.net/files.html">this
page for full details</a>. Although we accept additions of
non-Japanese characters and other obscure characters, requests for
missing characters such as simplified Chinese characters on the issues
page cannot be fulfilled. See the <a href="related.html">Related
projects</a> page for other projects which may supply them.
