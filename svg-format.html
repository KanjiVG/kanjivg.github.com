  <h1>SVG Format</h1>
</div>

<p>
This page details the SVG extensions used by KanjiVG to add
information on components of kanji, such as the radicals, as well as
information on the expected shapes of strokes.
</p>

<p>
All of the SVG extensions used by KanjiVG are XML attributes with an
added <code>kvg:</code> suffix, a "namespace" in XML terminology.
</p>

<p id="strokepaths-intro">
  There are two
  root <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/struct.html#Groups">SVG
  groups</a>. The <strong>StrokePaths</strong> group is a set of
  standard SVG paths that gives the strokes of the kanji. The strokes
  are ordered in the <a href="glossary.html#stroke-order">stroke
  order</a> given by the <a href="ref.html">references</a>. It also
  contains groups which describe the structure of the kanji, such as
  its decomposition into <a href="glossary.html#element">elements</a>,
  and which strokes comprise
  its <a href="glossary.html#radical">radical</a>.
</p>

<p id="strokenumbers-intro">
  The <strong>StrokeNumbers</strong> group is an optional group that
  gives a convenient position
  for <a href="#stroke-numbers">stroke-order numbers</a>, useful for
  displaying in printed material for instance. The stroke numbers are
  positioned near their corresponding strokes, at their starting
  points.
</p>

<p class='undocumented'>
  Undocumented and unknown features, and notes on possible flaws in
  the data, are distinguished with a pale green background.
</p>

<h2 id="strokepaths-groups">StrokePaths groups</h2>

<p>
  Kanji are often made of several components, referred to
  as <a href="glossary.html#element">elements</a> in this
  documentation. For instance,
  <a href="viewer.html?kanji=頑">頑</a> can be seen as a combination of
  <a href="viewer.html?kanji=元">元</a> on its left and
  <a href="viewer.html?kanji=頁">頁</a> on its right. KanjiVG uses SVG
  groups to reflect this structure, so the KanjiVG entry contains two
  groups under the parent <code>StrokePaths</code> group containing
  the left and right side of the kanji. The 元 and 頁 are encoded in
  these groups under their <a href="#element">element</a>
  attributes. SVG groups provide an elegant way to collect strokes
  into a given group.
</p>
<p>
  In the case that the elements do not consist of contiguous strokes,
  KanjiVG uses the <a href="#part">part</a>
  and <a href="#number">number</a> XML attributes to distinguish them.
</p>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KanjiVG/kanjivg/master/kanji/09811.svg" width="436" height="436">

<p>
  This section explains the SVG attributes used in the groups under
  the <strong>StrokePaths</strong> group which describe the structure
  of a kanji, such as radicals and other sub-elements.
</p>

<h3>General attributes</h3>

<h4 id="group-id">id</h4>

<p>
  The KanjiVG identification number for this group. It contains the
  Unicode value of the kanji as a five-digit lower-case hexadecimal
  number, followed by a hyphen and the letter "g", followed by a decimal
  number from one to the total number of groups.
</p>

<p>
  The group ID numbers are always consecutive positive whole numbers.
</p>

<h3>KVG namespace attributes</h3>

<p>
  All these attributes are placed under the <strong>kvg</strong>
  namespace, for example <code>kvg:original="家"</code>
</p>


<h4 id="element">element</h4>

<p>
  This attribute specifies which kanji best represents the group
  physically. It should be the Unicode character that resembles the
  group as much as possible.
</p>

<p>
  The value of <code>element</code> on the outermost group of the
  strokes is the same as the kanji represented by the SVG.
</p>

<h4 id="number">number</h4>

<p>
  This relatively rare attribute allows an element of a kanji to be
  identified when it is both represented several times in the kanji,
  and, due to the stroke order, more than one of these representations
  is broken into parts, so that the <a href="#part">part attribute</a>
  has to be used for more than one element. In other words, the number
  attribute is a way to uniquely identify the part when it becomes
  ambiguous.
</p>

<p>
  It is only used in a few places in kanjivg where there are two
  different sets of the same element, such as 05716.svg, the character
  圖, where there are four 口 elements, two of which are broken into
  parts one and two due to the stroke order. Please
  inspect <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KanjiVG/kanjivg/master/kanji/05716.svg">the
  source code of that SVG file</a> to understand
  what <code>kvg:number</code> attribute does.
</p>

<p>
  Generally, elements which can be represented by contiguous blocks of
  strokes do not have a number attribute, even if multiple cases of
  the same element occur in a character, so, for example, the 口
  elements of 品 do not have a number attribute.
</p>

<h4 id="original">original</h4>

<p>
  This attribute specifies which kanji represents the group from a
  semantic point of view.  This attribute only needs to be present if
  there is a difference between the semantic and physical
  representation of the group.
</p>

<p>
  For example, <a href="viewer.html?kanji=仮">仮</a> has two groups.
  The left one has <a href="viewer.html?kanji=亻">亻</a>
  (called <em>ninben</em>) for its <code>element</code> attribute, and
  <a href="viewer.html?kanji=人">人</a>, meaning "person", for
  its <code>original</code> attribute, because <em>ninben</em> is a
  variation of 人.  However, the right side has
  <a href="viewer.html?kanji=反">反</a> for <code>element</code>,
  which is not a variation, so an <code>original</code> attribute is
  not necessary.

<h4 id="part">part</h4>

<p>
  When the elements of a group of kanji strokes which forms a larger
  unit are not consecutive strokes, the group of strokes may be spread
  over several groups of paths in the file. The <strong>part</strong>
  attribute allows numbering these groups and defines them as being
  part of the same component. There is also a <a href="#number">number
  attribute</a> which can be used in the rare cases that two groups
  with the same element have non-consecutive strokes within the same
  character.
</p>

<h4 id="partial">partial</h4>

<p>
  Should be present and set to <strong>true</strong> if the group only
  represents the <strong>element</strong> attribute partially, i.e. if
  not all its strokes are present.
</p>

<h4 id="phon">phon</h4>

<p>
  A large number of kanji consist of a radical and a phoneticum, the
  Sino-Japanese pronunciation. The <code>phon</code> attribute should
  mark the part indicating the pronunciation. 
</p>

  The values of this attribute are inconsistent, and the meanings of
  many of them are completely
  undocumented. See

  Github</a>

  for more details.

  groups with the same parent. Not every element has a "position"
  value. Possible values are

<p>
  Unicode has more than one code point which may represent each

<p class='undocumented'>

</p>

<h2>Strokes</h2>

<p>
  Each individual kanji stroke is represented by one SVG &lt;path&gt;
  element.
</p>


<h3>General attributes</h3>

<h4 id="d">d</h4>

<p>
  The SVG path information itself. This describes the shape of the
  line.
</p>

<p>
  Although there is no rule disallowing various SVG elements, in
  practice all of the KanjiVG data consists of cubic bezier curves. In
  the SVG terminology the path is made up of only M/m, C/c, and S/s
  elements. There are no other SVG path elements present. None of the
  strokes contains a path with more than one sub-path, that is to say
  there are no strokes with more than one "moveto" element.
</p>

<h4 id="stroke-id">id</h4>

<p>
  The KanjiVG identification number for this stroke. It contains the
  prefix <code>kvg:</code> followed by the Unicode value of the kanji
  as a five-digit lower-case hexadecimal number, followed by any
  variant information, followed by a hyphen and the letter "s",
  followed by a decimal number from one to the total stroke count. For
  example stroke 3 of the file <code>kanji/053ec.svg</code> has the ID
  number <code>kvg:053ec-s3</code>.
</p>

<p>
  The stroke IDs are consecutive positive whole numbers starting from
  1 which correspond to <a href="#stroke-numbers">the stroke
  number</a> of the stroke.
</p>

<h3>KVG namespace attributes</h3>

<p>
  These attributes are under the <code>kvg:</code> namespace.
</p>

<h4 id="type">type</h4>

<p>
  The shape of the stroke. It can be used to know how the stroke
  should be rendered.
</p>

<p>
  The values of this attribute use the keys of
  Unicode's <a href="glossary.html#cjk-strokes">CJK Strokes</a>, which
  occupy code positions from U+31C0 to U+31EF. The names of these,
  such as D or HZ, are the initials of the Chinese names.
</p>

<p>
  Please see the <a href="stroke-types.html">Stroke types</a> page for full
  information on stroke types.
</p>

<h2 id="stroke-numbers">Stroke numbers</h2>

<p>
  Stroke numbers are represented by a top-level group with an ID of
  the form <code>kvg:StrokeNumbers_abcde</code>,
  where <code>abcde</code> is the identifier of the file. This group
  contains <code>text</code> elements. Each text element is located on
  the diagram using a <code>transform</code> attribute. The text
  within each text element is the stroke number in digits, from one to
  the total number of strokes. The stroke numbers <em>should</em>
  correspond to the <a href="#stroke-id">id value of the individual
  strokes</a>.
</p>

<p>
  The stroke numbers are located to the side of the beginning of the
  stroke whose order they indicate. Generally, they should not overlap
  the strokes.
</p>
