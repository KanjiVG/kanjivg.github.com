<p>
This page lists known problems with some of the files.
</p>

<h2>Duplicate files</h2>

<p>
The following files seem to have been duplicated during the creation
of the KanjiVG files.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
0514e-Hyougai.svg and 0514e-Jinmei.svg are essentially the same
variant, but with slightly different stroke positions.
</li>
<li>
07149-Jinmei.svg is an unnecessary duplicate of 07149.svg with
slightly different stroke positions.
</li>
</ul>

<section id="stroke-order">
<h2>Kanji with unusual stroke orders</h2>
<p>
This section lists cases of unusual stroke orders in the files.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
05bb6-Kaisho.svg has strokes 2 and 3 of the 豕 element swapped from
the usual order, but none of the other -Kaisho files containing a 豕
element features this stroke order.
</li>
</ul>

<section id="kvg-phon-undocumented">
<h2>kvg:phon is undocumented</h2>
<p>
The meaning of the <code>kvg:phon</code> attribute has never been
clearly documented or even publicly explained. Some of them consist of
sequences of numbers separated with plus signs, the meaning of which
is unclear.
</p>
</section>

<section id="kvg-type-alphabetical">
<h2>kvg:type alphabetical codes are undocumented</h2>

<p>
The meaning of the alphabetical letters after the values
of <code>kvg:type</code> have never been clearly documented or even
publicly explained.
