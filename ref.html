    The JIS Kanji Jiten (JIS 漢字字典) is the kanji dictionary of the

    authoritative on kanji radicals by Jim Breen, the author of Kanjidic,
    upon which KanjiVG was originally based, thus the radicals given in
    this reference are used in Kanjidic as the "traditional" radical,
    which sometimes diverge from the radical used by this project as
