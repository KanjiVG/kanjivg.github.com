  <h1>Radicals in KanjiVG</h1>
</div>

<p>
  KanjiVG contains information on
  the <a href="glossary.html#radical">radical</a> used by each
  kanji. Since different authors use different radicals for the same
  kanji, it provides several different choices of radical, such
  as <code>general</code> for generally-accepted radicals,
  or <code>nelson</code>
  for <a href="glossary.html#nelson-radicals">the radicals used by the
  Nelson kanji dictionary</a>. See
  <a href="svg-format.html#radical">the SVG Format page</a> for a
  complete list of possible values.
</p>

<p>
  This page details the choices made for the values of
  <a href="svg-format.html#element"><code>kvg:element</code></a>, the visual
  representation of a kanji radical.
</p>

<p>
  For all of the <a href="glossary.html#variant-radical">non-variant
  radical</a> forms, there are two equivalent Unicode code points with
  the same visual form. One is in
  the <a href="glossary.html#kangxi-radicals-block">Kangxi Radicals
  block</a>, and the other is in
  the <a href="glossary.html#cjk-unified-ideographs">CJK Unified
  Ideograph block</a>, where the same radicals are scattered
  throughout. The equivalence between these two sets of identical
  radicals is given in the Unicode Character Database (UCD) in the
  file
  <a href="https://www.unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucd/CJKRadicals.txt">CJKRadicals.txt</a>,
  which maps between the pairs.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>
    KanjiVG uses only the CJK Unified Ideograph versions of these
    equivalent entries.
  </strong>
  KanjiVG does not use the Kangxi Radicals block at all. Where a
  <a href="glossary.html#variant-radical">variant radical</a> is used,
  KanjiVG also specifies the
  the <a href="svg-format.html#original"><code>kvg:original</code></a>
  field on the group. This also does not use the Kangxi Radicals block
  at all.
</p>

<p>
  However, KanjiVG does use some parts of
  the <a href="glossary.html#cjk-radicals-supplement">CJK Radicals
  Supplement block</a>. For example U+2E97 ⺗ is used for
  the <span class='romaji'>shitagokoro</span> variant of Kangxi
  radical 61, rather than
  the <a href="glossary.html#cjk-unified-ideographs">CJK Unified
  Ideographs</a> equivalent form U+38FA 㣺. The following section
  details the choices made by the KanjiVG authors.
</p>

<section id="radicals-used">

<h2>Radicals used</h2>

<section id="shin-nyo">
  <h3>
    Shin-nyō
  </h3>

<p>
  The radical used for Kangxi radical 162, "walk", known
  as <span class='romaji'>shin-nyō</span> in Japanese, is either
  U+8FB6 辶 for groups of four strokes, or U+2ECC ⻌ for groups of
  three strokes. (Depending on the font, U+8FB6 may appear to contain
  only three strokes.)
</p>

<p>
  The visually highly similar U+2ECD, from CJK Radicals Supplement,
  and U+FA66, from CJK Compatibility Ideographs, are not used by
  KanjiVG.
</p>

</section>

<section id="shoku-hen">

  <h3>
    Shoku-hen
  </h3>

  <p>
    For Kangxi radical 184, "eat", known
    as <span class='romaji'>shoku-hen</span> in Japanese, 飠 U+98E0
    from CJK Unified Ideographs is used for the eight-stroke variant,
    but ⻞ U+2EDE from CJK Radicals Supplement is used for the
    nine-stroke variant, since there does not seem to be a
    visually-close equivalent in the CJK Unified Ideographs.

This is used in two place in KanjiVG, one is kanji/072af.svg, but not
as a radical. It's also used as the radical for itself, U+353E. So
it's not really useful to add to this table. Software might need to
handle it, so I'm not sure what is best to do.

<h2>Special cases for Nelson radicals</h2>

<h3>Moon/meat</h3>

<p>
In some cases, such as kanji/06716.svg, Nelson changes the number of
the radical from 74 (Moon) to 130 (Meat), with the radical element
remaining the same. KanjiVG deals with this case by creating a doubled
grouping, with the Nelson radical group and the tradit radical group
around the same paths.
